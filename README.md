# Shopify Technical Assessment: ImgRepro

This is a minimal image repository that supports user registration/login and image management (private/public access control, upload/delete).

To start the server, start Mongodb server with data path located in folder './data', and run `npm run dev`. Then point your brower to localhost:3000.
